Hi there 👋
I’m Jay — a Data Scientist, Machine Learning & AI Engineer, and Business Intelligence Analyst passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights and intelligent solutions that drive business growth.

My journey began with a strong foundation in accounting and business analysis, and over time, I’ve evolved into the world of AI, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making. I love building systems that connect business strategy with technical innovation, using data as the bridge.

🚀 What I Do

🧩 Data Science & Analytics – Collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that guide smarter decisions.

🧠 Machine Learning & AI Engineering – Designing predictive models and intelligent systems using Python, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn to automate business processes.

📊 Business Intelligence – Building end-to-end KPI dashboards, data pipelines, and performance reporting systems that turn data into strategy.

🧮 Accounting-Driven Insights – Leveraging my background in accounting to interpret data through a financial and operational lens, helping businesses make grounded, data-backed decisions.

🤖 AI-Powered Applications – Experimenting with RAG-based chatbots, LLM integrations, and custom AI assistants that bring human-like intelligence into real-world contexts (like my “Bro to Bro” AI project 💬).
